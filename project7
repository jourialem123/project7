<h1>BEES</h1>
<h3 style="color: brown;"> Bees are very important in our lives because: </h3>
<p id="p1">Bees are essential for the health of people and the planet. Honey and other products have medicinal properties, and the
role of bees as pollinators makes them vital for food supplies.</p>
<h4 class="classy">How many species of bies are there:</h4>
<h4>There are around 20,000 known bee species worldwide, and over 4,000 are native to the United States. Humans only manage
a few of these, and most species are wild.</h4>
<h2>How much do bees actually help?</h2>
<h5>Around 75% of crops produce better yields if animals help them pollinate. Of all animals, bees are the most dominant
pollinators of wild and crop plants. They visit over 90% of the worldâ€™s top 107 crops.</h5>
